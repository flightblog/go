# The Go Programming Language

Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple,
reliable, and efficient software.

## Binary Distribution Notes

If you have just untarred a binary Go distribution, you need to set
the environment variable $GOROOT to the full path of the go
directory (the one containing this file).  You can omit the
variable if you unpack it into /usr/local/go, or if you rebuild
from sources by running all.bash (see doc/install-source.html).
You should also add the Go binary directory $GOROOT/bin
to your shell's path.

For example, if you extracted the tar file into $HOME/go, you might
put the following in your .profile:

	export GOROOT=$HOME/go
	export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin

See https://golang.org/doc/install or doc/install.html for more details.
